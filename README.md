#Abstract
This project provides an analysis of California's fossil-fueled power plants and their response to different emission reduction policy scenarios. 
An exploratory analysis is followed by emission-reduction simulations under market-driven cap-&-trade and command-&-control policies to comprehend the emission reduction
behavior of different types of power plants.
